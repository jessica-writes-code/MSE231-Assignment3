Trump	2016-08-07 23:09:08	Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
Trump	2016-08-07 21:31:46	The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!
Trump	2016-08-07 13:49:29	I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!

Trump	2016-08-06 14:48:14	Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."
Trump	2016-08-06 14:24:43	Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!
Trump	2016-08-06 11:53:00	Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

Staff	2016-08-01 14:48:22	#CrookedHillary  https://t.co/oHI6xrDJU0
Trump	2016-08-01 13:03:02	So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
Trump	2016-08-01 12:50:32	When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
Trump	2016-08-01 11:27:43	This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
Trump	2016-08-01 11:10:51	Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
Trump	2016-08-01 00:57:15	Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
Trump	2016-07-31 20:31:06	"@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope."
Trump	2016-07-31 20:09:00	The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
Trump	2016-07-31 13:32:55	I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
Trump	2016-07-31 03:32:40	Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
Trump	2016-07-30 23:00:07	Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
Trump	2016-07-30 22:28:22	Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews

Trump	2016-07-30 22:12:36	The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
Trump	2016-07-30 22:04:14	Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP

Trump	2016-07-30 21:51:25	Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
Trump	2016-07-30 19:55:26	Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

Trump	2016-07-27 12:57:20	Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
Trump	2016-07-27 10:08:35	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Trump	2016-07-27 10:01:39	Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Trump	2016-07-27 09:50:55	The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Trump	2016-07-27 09:43:16	Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
Trump	2016-07-27 09:33:52	As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Trump	2016-07-26 12:34:19	Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
Trump	2016-07-26 03:19:38	Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Trump	2016-07-26 03:12:57	Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
Staff	2016-07-26 03:04:56	Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.

Staff	2016-07-25 21:32:59	Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Trump	2016-07-25 14:01:25	The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Trump	2016-07-25 13:42:55	Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Trump	2016-07-24 22:16:59	The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
Trump	2016-07-24 22:07:49	Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Trump	2016-07-24 20:45:31	The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
Trump	2016-07-24 20:30:06	I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
Trump	2016-07-24 13:30:59	Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
Trump	2016-07-24 13:27:56	There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
Trump	2016-07-24 12:30:15	An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Trump	2016-07-24 12:15:51	Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
Trump	2016-07-24 11:56:43	Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Trump	2016-07-24 11:25:06	Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Trump	2016-07-24 11:16:15	The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Trump	2016-07-23 22:05:55	Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
Staff	2016-07-23 21:20:58	The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
Trump	2016-07-23 20:43:33	Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
Trump	2016-07-23 16:06:15	I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Trump	2016-07-23 15:36:41	Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Trump	2016-07-23 15:01:48	Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Trump	2016-07-23 14:51:32	Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Trump	2016-07-23 10:55:20	Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Trump	2016-07-23 10:42:10	Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Trump	2016-07-23 10:35:37	Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Trump	2016-07-23 10:31:18	The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
Trump	2016-07-23 03:56:38	"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
Trump	2016-07-23 03:49:04	I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Trump	2016-07-23 03:23:15	Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
Trump	2016-07-22 13:13:02	Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
